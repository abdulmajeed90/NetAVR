The NetAVR project was founded in 2010 by Roy van Dam, David
Vaessen and Ramon Kleiss as part of the course data communication
at the HAN University of Applied Sciences.

The project's goal is to create an `educational' tcp/ip stack for
small embedded devices like the AVR. 

The current condition of the project still remains in an experimental
stage where ARP, ICMP and UDP have been implemented and tested. TCP,
DHCP, Packet queueing and network sockets are in preliminary state.
